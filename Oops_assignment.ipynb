        "-> Here are the key advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Modularity and Reusability:** Objects are self-contained units. This makes code more modular, easier to manage, and reusable across different parts of the program or in other projects. You can create new objects or classes based on existing ones (inheritance).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Maintainability:** Because code is organized into objects, it's easier to update, debug, and maintain. Changes in one part of the program are less likely to affect other parts due to encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Flexibility (Polymorphism):** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface. This makes code more flexible and allows you to write generic functions that can work with various object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Abstraction:** OOP allows you to hide complex implementation details and expose only the necessary features of an object. This simplifies the interaction with objects and reduces the cognitive load on developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit (an object). This protects data from accidental modification and provides better control over how data is accessed and changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Improved Software Development Productivity:** By using inheritance and polymorphism, developers can build new systems faster and more efficiently by reusing existing components.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **Better Structure and Organization:** OOP provides a clear structure for programs, making them easier to understand and navigate, especially for large and complex applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  **Ease of Testing:** Since objects are independent units, they can be tested in isolation, making the testing process more straightforward and efficient.\n",

        "-> Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" is a core concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, polymorphism with inheritance primarily works through **method overriding**.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a child class inherits from a parent class and provides its own implementation for a method that is already defined in the parent class (method overriding), you can then call that method on objects of either the parent or child class. Python determines which specific method implementation to call at runtime based on the actual type of the object, not the type of the variable referencing it. This is known as **dynamic polymorphism** or **runtime polymorphism**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works with Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Parent Class:** Defines a method (e.g., `speak()`).\n",
        "2.  **Child Classes:** Inherit from the parent class and **override** the same method (`speak()`) to provide their own specific behavior.\n",
        "3.  **Common Interface:** Even though child classes have different implementations of `speak()`, they all share the same method name and signature as the parent class.\n",
        "4.  **Runtime Binding:** When you call the `speak()` method on a variable that could hold an object of the parent class or any of its child classes, Python figures out the object's actual type at runtime and executes the corresponding `speak()` method from that specific class.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows you to write code that operates on a collection of objects of different types (as long as they share a common parent or interface) in a uniform way.\n",
